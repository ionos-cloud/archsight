  annotations:
    architecture/description: |
      HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport for the Model Context
      Protocol (MCP). Enables network-accessible MCP servers with:

      - `GET /sse` - SSE endpoint for server-to-client streaming
      - `POST /message` - HTTP endpoint for client-to-server messages

      This transport allows MCP servers to be accessed over HTTP, making
      them suitable for web-based integrations and remote access.
